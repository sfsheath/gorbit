gorbit
======

Making the freely available and excellent Orbis data just a little bit easier to use.

Three sources of Orbis data were used to start this repository:

* https://github.com/emeeks/orbis_v2 (MIT Licensed)
* http://purl.stanford.edu/mn425tz9757 (CC-By licensed)
* http://orbis.stanford.edu/api/ (No explicit license given??)

Notes
=====

* gorbit-nodes is combination of nodes from the github and purl.stanford.edu data.
* gorbit-sites.csv is a conversion of the JSON in api-sites.json into CSV. This was done in RStudio.

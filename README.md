gorbit
======

Making the freely available and excellent Orbis data just a little bit easier to use.

Two sources of Orbis data were used to start this repository:

* https://github.com/emeeks/orbis_v2 (MIT Licensed)
* http://purl.stanford.edu/mn425tz9757 (CC-By licensed)

Notes
=====

gorbit-nodes is combination of nodes from the github and purl.stanford.edu data.
